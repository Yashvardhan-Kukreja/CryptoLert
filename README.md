<h2> Bitcoin Rate tracker and Alert </h2>

So, I love Silicon Valley TV Show, and the place also. So, I saw one of its episodes in which Gilfoyle builds a program to alert him whenever a decent amount of increase occurs in the Bitcoin Rate. In this way, he knows when is the right time to power up his rig to mine bitcoins.

So, I created the same program with a slightly different logic. The logic is that whenever there is an increase or decrease of more than 0.11% in the rate of bitcoin, the laptop shouts like in that episode, Gilfoyle's alert used to shout like "BWAAAAAH!!!!".
